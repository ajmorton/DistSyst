Authenticated Users:
	- Password
		- Make second login not ask for confirm password
			- added a enterPassword() method for single password entry
	- (Possibly) automatically authenticate again
		- Re create file in client directory
	- Get client to use local config file on start to log authenticated users in

HANDSHAKE (only if automatic authentication is implemented)
requires changes to initial connect that may be difficult
	- on connect server sends #hasauth to client
	- client returns {username, hash} or NULL dependent on local file
		- need to make sure that we can verify if local file exists
		- need to make sure there is a way to reject invalid 
		  user/password for example if server restarts in between quit and reconnect
	- depending on if authentication succeeds or not assign to guest num
		- do we want to move user back to previous room
			// no, rooms may be deleted
				

check I/O
	no test suites so cosmetics only 
	
	if a client abruptly disconnects and this is only discovered while a new 
	client connects there is messiness on the connecting clients UI:
	
			guest3 moved from  to MainHall
		
			guest2 moved from MainHall to 
			[MainHall] guest3> MainHall contains guest1 guest3
			MainHall: 2
			[MainHall] guest3> 

	in this case guest2 abruptly disconnected and the disconnection was detected during guest3's connection
	need to ignore the guest2 moved from MainHall message

	failed #delete doesn't return anything, doesn't print prompt
	failed #kick doesn't return anything, doens't print prompt
	invalid #join doesn't print prompt
	
does takePassword work on non-osx?

certificate expiry

double check #who	
	should be good, especially since we demonstrate rather than pass a test suite
	
Full functionality test
	run through all command to verify
