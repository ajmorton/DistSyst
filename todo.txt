Authenticated Users:
	- Password
		- Make second login not ask for confirm password
	- Privileges for authenticated users only wrt. rooms
		- Delete room
		- Kick user
	- Changing identity from authenticated user
		- Remove previous identity from list
			- Do room ownership changes?
		- (Possibly) automatically authenticate again
			- Re create file in client directory
	- Get client to use local config file on start to log authenticated users in

check I/O
	no test suites so cosmetics only 
	
	if a client abruptly disconnects and this is only discovered while a new 
	client connects there is messiness on the connecting clients UI:
	
			guest3 moved from  to MainHall
		
			guest2 moved from MainHall to 
			[MainHall] guest3> MainHall contains guest1 guest3
			MainHall: 2
			[MainHall] guest3> 

	in this case guest2 abruptly disconnected and the disconnection was detected during guest3's connection
	need to ignore the guest2 moved from Mainhall message

double check #who	
	should be good, especially since we demonstrate rather than pass a test suite
